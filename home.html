    <h1> 2016 primayr elections </h1>
    <p>This website is about the 2016 primary elections and comes from the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/election/election.html">CORGIS Data Progect</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/parties/republican">CNN</a>. 
      The data is a long list of how all U.S. counties voted in the primaries of the 2016 election. 
      The CNN website also contains a map of how the states voted, who won the primaries over all, and exit poll
      results for a few states. For example, in the democratic primaries Clinton won over all and took most of the south, southwest, and a 
      lot of the northeast, while Sanders won most of the midwest, northwest , and some of the northeast. Generally older people voted for Clinton
      and younger people voted for Sanders. Lower income people generally also preferd Sanders while higher income people favored Clinton
      and so on. Trump won the republican primaries over all.</p>
